# Plank-Project
 
Plank is a side project that I developed on my own, in the second year of my studies. It is a lightweight UI dashboard for a fictional furniture company. Designed with Bootstrap4, coded with Django Framework and connected with SQLite database, it has a few basic features: authentication system, multiple categories of users with the option to create more, admin page for creating users and modifying permissions accordingly, forms for adding and modifying entries from the database.
